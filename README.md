## Introduction

 **This is a program that works on 2D linear programming problem using CUDA\THRUST toolkit.**

The repo includes the naive CPU version( actually not naive at all XD ),

the GPU version using the Meggido's method,

and an advanced GPU version applying the V-shape tricks that removed more lines compared with Meggido's method where 1/4 of all the lines are removed in one iteration.
